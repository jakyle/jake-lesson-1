# Lesson 1 - About Me

In this lesson, you will be providing your personal information and display it all in a pop-out. In order to gather all of the information, you will need to use the ```prompt()``` function. The information you need to gather is...

1. First Name
2. Last Name
3. Age
4. Favorite Hobby


Once you have gathered all of this information, ```alert()``` a sentence containing said information

for example 
```
I'm Jacob Hoover, I am 29 and I like to make video games!
```

Afterwords, show another ```alert()``` displaying if your age is an even or odd number, for example

```
my age is even
```

or 

```
my age is odd
```
